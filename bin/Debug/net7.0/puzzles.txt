fun in the sun
a slice of heaven
lets go shopping
over the rainbow
a bird in the hand
happy birthday to you
around the world
don't stop believing
a breath of fresh air
beach party
a picture is worth a thousand words
hit the jackpot
a stitch in time saves nine
all in a day's work
you are what you eat
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
once in a lifetime
the thrill of victory
a diamond in the rough
a penny saved is a penny earned
all that glitters is not gold
a rolling stone gathers no moss
the early bird catches the worm
a taste of honey
the grass is always greener on the other side
an apple a day keeps the doctor away
a watched pot never boils
to be or not to be
the road less traveled
actions speak louder than words
